Trained with:
___________________
LH of LHShake -> 1 |
LH of RHShake -> 0 |
___________________|

All 50000 files were used!
It was introduzed a absolute velocities on a vector features!
	It was NOT introduzed 5000 examples with StaticHandsUp to the data!
	It was NOT introduzed 10000 examples with generated StaticHandsUp to the data!
It Was taken JUST the VELOCITIES! No positions are included!
