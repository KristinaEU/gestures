All 50000 files were used!
It was introduzed a absolute velocities on a vector features!
	It was introduzed 5000 examples with StaticHandsUp to the data!
	It was introduzed 10000 examples with generated StaticHandsUp to the data!
It was added the polynomies(degree 6)
Code rearanged 
createListOfStaticPositions
createListOfCircularPositions
It was added the polynomies for velocities (degree 3)
